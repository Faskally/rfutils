#' logLik_gam
#'
#' Log likelihood function for use in model selection of mixed models using gam or bam
#' Hereâ€™s a function for extracting the log likelihood and (harder) the degrees of freedom 
#' out of a gam or bam model.  The degrees of freedom are the number of fixed effects plus 
#' the number of variances (not the edf as is usually reported by gam) and assumes the 
#' models are fitted by ML.
#' 
#' The function has been tested with a range of smoothers, but as good check would involve 
#' fitting models in gam and also in gamm4 and check the df are the same.
